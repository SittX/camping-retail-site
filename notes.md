## About W3C
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community where Member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop Web standards. Led by Web inventor and Director Tim Berners-Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe, W3C's mission is to lead the Web to its full potential. Contact W3C for more information.

### What does W3C do?
W3C's primary activity is to develop protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the Web. W3C's standards define key parts of what makes the World Wide Web work. Learn more about W3C's mission.

## Where is W3C located?
W3C does not have a single physical headquarters. There are four institutions that "host" W3C: MIT (in Cambridge, MA, USA), ERCIM (in Sophia-Antipolis, France), Keio University (near Tokyo, Japan), and Beihang University (in Beijing, China).

The W3C staff is distributed around the world, but there are concentrations of people in Cambridge, Massachusetts (USA), Sophia-Antipolis (France), Tokyo (Japan) and Beijing (China). In addition, W3C is represented by W3C Evangelists or W3C Chapters in various locations.

## W3C has a validation service. Does W3C approve all Web pages?
No. W3C does provide a free service for validating Web pages against standard formats. Although validation is not mandatory on the Web, it is useful for improving the quality of pages.
